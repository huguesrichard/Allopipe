# The AMS pipeline

What does it do ? 

The pipeline was developed to estimate the Allogenomics Mismatch Score between a potential donor and a recipient for transplantation.
The current version of the pipeline was tested on exomic data, for transplantations of kidney and HSC for genoidentical patients.

This pipeline allows you to choose parameters to filter the data.
